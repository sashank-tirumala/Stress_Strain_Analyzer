This project basically implements Dirac Delta Function as Singularity Function in order to analyze the stress in a beam for any sort of variable loading
BeamClass makes a new beam, specifies supports and this is the class where we note down the loadings
Singularity Class implements Dirac Delta Function. Crucially it implements the differentiation and Integration of the Dirac Delta Function.
User Interface basically adds a user interface for easy use for a non coder (No need of instantiating objects etc)
Rest are tests and solvers needn't be touched

This code is close to working, but I think it has some errors. I seem to have lost the latest version and am not maintaining this anymore. I encourage anyone to go ahead and fix it, or maybe use it as an inspiration for a more better solver?
